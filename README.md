# UpperConfidenceBoundAlg
Python Package for using an Upper Confidence Bound

Also included is a test script and a .csv containing reward values for an advertising test with 10 variables and 10,000 observations

Function will run after .csv is converted to a pandas dataframe.

The function is meant to only run until a superior variable has been found. Continuing to run the function would find a more accurate 
upper confidence bound value, comments on code have more information.
